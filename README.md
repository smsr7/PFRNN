# PFRNN-Pandemic-Modeling
Pandemic modeling and optimal testing strategy using Particle Filter Recurrent Neural Networks 

# To Run:
For each expeirment set, the associated python file pf_rnn_*.py can be run
Result data is stored in the "results" directory
Results can be graphed from files in the "graphing" directory
