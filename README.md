# PFRNN-Pandemic-Modeling
Pandemic modeling and optimal testing strategy using Particle Filter Recurrent Neural Networks 

# To Run:
  Create directory for "results"
  
  Install any requirments
  
  Run any files labled PFRNN_* for specific experiments
  
  Files in the Graphing folder can be used to plot different experiments
